# 🏗️ LNG Refinery Construction Performance Dashboard (Excel+Tableau)

**Developer:** Rahardian G. Patria  
**Tools:** Tableau | Excel  
**Domain:** Infrastructure & Energy Projects  
**Type of Data:** Case Study/Sample data  

---

## 📘 Overview
This project presents a comprehensive **Project Performance Dashboard** for a large-scale **LNG Refinery Expansion Project**.  
The dashboard visualizes **financial performance, schedule progress, and activity-level delays**, providing clear insights for both project managers and executives.

It was built using **Tableau** for data visualization and **Excel** for data preparation. The output helps management track budget utilization, detect schedule bottlenecks, and decide on acceleration or cost-control measures.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Evaluate **budget vs. actual spending** at monthly and quarterly levels  
- Monitor **schedule progress** across key construction activities  
- Identify **critical-path delays** and their root causes  
- Provide **board-level recommendations** to ensure completion under budget  

---
## 🎯 Dashboard Design Targets

This dashboard was structured across **three analytical pages** — Financial and Execution — to help project stakeholders monitor both budget utilization and schedule performance in real time.

---

### 📊 Dashboard Page 1 – Financial View

#### **KPI Overview**
- Display a summary of **budget consumed** and percentage utilization.  
- Provide a quick visual cue for **total planned vs actual investment**.

#### **Budget Consumption Trends**
- Present both **quarterly** and **monthly** consumption trends for the fiscal year.  
- Identify **months with the highest and lowest achievements** for quick recognition.  
- Include clear **planned vs actual** comparisons to track deviations.  
- Highlight **months/quarters above or below average** to draw attention to anomalies in financial performance.

#### **Tables – Monitoring Delay Causes**
- Present **variances in financial performance** alongside their corresponding **delay causes**.  
- Enable easy traceability between budget deviation and project execution issues.

#### **Budget Remaining Over Time**
- Visualize the **remaining budget** across the months to show financial headroom.  
- Highlight when the buffer starts to narrow, indicating potential risk for overruns.

---

### 🏗️ Dashboard Page 2 – Execution View

#### **KPI Overview**
- Display overall **project progress percentage** as of November-end.  
- Compare **planned vs actual progress** in an at-a-glance visual.

#### **Critical Path**
- Display the **critical path** of the schedule using a Gantt or timeline visualization.  
- Emphasize dependencies and key bottleneck activities affecting completion.

#### **Current Progress**
- Compare **planned vs actual timelines** for each major phase.  
- Highlight slippages and recovery actions to communicate schedule health.

#### **Project Progress by Activity**
- Break down **progress per activity** (e.g., Civil, Procurement, Installation, Commissioning).  
- Identify **delayed activities**, their **root causes**, and quantify **delay days or slacks**.  
- Clearly distinguish between **critical** and **non-critical** paths for better prioritization.

---
### 🏗️ Dashboard Page 3 – Summary and Strategy for Board Member

#### **Summary**
- Present the strategy to avoid the delay if possible.  
- Present the strategy to ensure project within budget constraint.

> 🧩 *Together, these two pages create a holistic view of project performance — financial and operational — enabling the Board to identify risks early, make data-driven decisions, and maintain control over both budget and schedule.*

## 🧩 Tools & Skills Demonstrated
- **Tableau** – dashboard design, data blending, calculated fields  
- **Excel** – data cleaning, aggregation, performance tracking  
- **Project Analytics** – schedule variance, budget utilization, critical-path logic  
- **Business Intelligence Communication** – translating technical data into executive-level insight  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Early-phase delays caused by **land acquisition** and **procurement issues** compressed the construction timeline.  
- **Acceleration in Q4** improved completion rates but increased cost-efficiency risk.  
- By **November 2024**, **88.9 % of the annual budget** was used and overall completion reached **~93 %**.  
- Project remains **under budget**, but requires strict cost governance to meet **Feb 2025 completion**.

## 🧭 Insight Focus

### 📈 Page 1 – Financial View (Budget Realization & Trends)

**Pyramid Principle Flow:** *Situation → Complication → Resolution*

**Situation (what the Board already knows):**  
The refinery expansion program had a planned annual investment of **$900M** for 2024.  
Actual realization by **November** was **$800M (~88.9%)**. On paper, the project is still under budget.

**Complication (what the Board might not see immediately):**
- Investment realization was uneven across quarters:  
  - **Q1:** 80% (under target due to procurement delays)  
  - **Q2:** 90% (progress stabilized)  
  - **Q3:** 76% (land acquisition stalled civil works)  
  - **Q4:** 103% (overshoot driven by EPC acceleration)
- This pattern shows early under-spending followed by a backloaded catch-up surge, which introduces risks:
  - **Execution pressure:** compressing activities into late quarters  
  - **Cost inefficiency:** Q4 overshoot (+3.3%) came with higher costs (overtime, premium contracts)  
  - **Thin margin:** only **11% of budget** remains to cover final stages  

**Resolution (what this means):**  
Financially, the project is not yet over budget, but the spending profile reveals **structural risk**.  
Early underutilization forced a late sprint that consumed flexibility.  
Without stricter cost governance, acceleration may erode the budget buffer during installation and commissioning.

**Narrative for the Board:**  
> “Financially, the project looks under control at **89% realization**, but the story behind the numbers matters.  
> Under-spend in Q1 and Q3 created a backlog that had to be recovered in Q4 with costly EPC acceleration.  
> This left only **11% of budget** available heading into final commissioning.  
> In short, we are under budget, but we are also under pressure — cost governance will be critical if we want to finish without overruns.”

### 🏗️ Page 2 – Execution View (Critical Path & Progress)

**Pyramid Principle Flow:** *Situation → Complication → Resolution*

**Situation (what the Board already knows):**  
The project started **February 2024** with planned completion in **November 2024**.  
Feasibility Study (FS) and Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) are complete.  
Current progress is **~92–93%**, and forecast completion has shifted to **February 2025 (≈3 months delay)**.

**Complication (the hidden root causes):**
- **Critical Path:** FS → FEED → Procurement → Civil → Installation → Commissioning  
- Two key activities are driving delays:
  - **Procurement:** ~70-day delay (late vendor deliveries)  
  - **Civil Construction:** ~112-day delay (land acquisition & contractor slippage)  
- Downstream acceleration (installation, commissioning) helps but cannot erase upstream slippage.  
- **Risks identified:**
  - **Schedule Risk:** Commissioning start compressed  
  - **Cost Risk:** EPC acceleration costs escalate if repeated  
  - **Quality Risk:** Shortcuts may bypass QA/QC and trigger rework  

**Resolution (what this means):**  
The project’s overall timeline remains recoverable, but schedule compression has **eroded the safety margin**.  
Without disciplined sequencing and QA/QC enforcement, acceleration could trade speed for rework — offsetting financial gains.
