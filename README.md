# 🏗️ LNG Refinery Construction Performance Dashboard (Excel+Tableau)

**Developer:** Rahardian G. Patria  
**Tools:** Tableau | Excel  
**Domain:** Infrastructure & Energy Projects  
**Type of Data:** Case Study/Sample data  

---

## 📘 Overview
This project presents a comprehensive **Project Performance Dashboard** for a large-scale **LNG Refinery Expansion Project**.  
The dashboard visualizes **financial performance, schedule progress, and activity-level delays**, providing clear insights for both project managers and executives.

It was built using **Tableau** for data visualization and **Excel** for data preparation. The output helps management track budget utilization, detect schedule bottlenecks, and decide on acceleration or cost-control measures.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Evaluate **budget vs. actual spending** at monthly and quarterly levels  
- Monitor **schedule progress** across key construction activities  
- Identify **critical-path delays** and their root causes  
- Provide **board-level recommendations** to ensure completion under budget  

---

## 🧩 Tools & Skills Demonstrated
- **Tableau** – dashboard design, data blending, calculated fields  
- **Excel** – data cleaning, aggregation, performance tracking  
- **Project Analytics** – schedule variance, budget utilization, critical-path logic  
- **Business Intelligence Communication** – translating technical data into executive-level insight  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Early-phase delays caused by **land acquisition** and **procurement issues** compressed the construction timeline.  
- **Acceleration in Q4** improved completion rates but increased cost-efficiency risk.  
- By **November 2024**, **88.9 % of the annual budget** was used and overall completion reached **~93 %**.  
- Project remains **under budget**, but requires strict cost governance to meet **Feb 2025 completion**.

## 🧭 Insight Focus

### 📈 Page 1 – Financial View (Budget Realization & Trends)

**Pyramid Principle Flow:** *Situation → Complication → Resolution*

**Situation (what the Board already knows):**  
The refinery expansion program had a planned annual investment of **$900M** for 2024.  
Actual realization by **November** was **$800M (~88.9%)**. On paper, the project is still under budget.

**Complication (what the Board might not see immediately):**
- Investment realization was uneven across quarters:  
  - **Q1:** 80% (under target due to procurement delays)  
  - **Q2:** 90% (progress stabilized)  
  - **Q3:** 76% (land acquisition stalled civil works)  
  - **Q4:** 103% (overshoot driven by EPC acceleration)
- This pattern shows early under-spending followed by a backloaded catch-up surge, which introduces risks:
  - **Execution pressure:** compressing activities into late quarters  
  - **Cost inefficiency:** Q4 overshoot (+3.3%) came with higher costs (overtime, premium contracts)  
  - **Thin margin:** only **11% of budget** remains to cover final stages  

**Resolution (what this means):**  
Financially, the project is not yet over budget, but the spending profile reveals **structural risk**.  
Early underutilization forced a late sprint that consumed flexibility.  
Without stricter cost governance, acceleration may erode the budget buffer during installation and commissioning.

**Narrative for the Board:**  
> “Financially, the project looks under control at **89% realization**, but the story behind the numbers matters.  
> Under-spend in Q1 and Q3 created a backlog that had to be recovered in Q4 with costly EPC acceleration.  
> This left only **11% of budget** available heading into final commissioning.  
> In short, we are under budget, but we are also under pressure — cost governance will be critical if we want to finish without overruns.”
