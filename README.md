# 🏗️ LNG Refinery Construction Performance Dashboard

**Developer:** Rahardian G. Patria  
**Tools:** Tableau | Excel  
**Domain:** Infrastructure & Energy Projects  
**Project Timeline:** Feb 2024 – Feb 2025  

---

## 📘 Overview
This project presents a comprehensive **Project Performance Dashboard** for a large-scale **LNG Refinery Expansion Project**.  
The dashboard visualizes **financial performance, schedule progress, and activity-level delays**, providing clear insights for both project managers and executives.

It was built using **Tableau** for data visualization and **Excel** for data preparation. The output helps management track budget utilization, detect schedule bottlenecks, and decide on acceleration or cost-control measures.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Evaluate **budget vs. actual spending** at monthly and quarterly levels  
- Monitor **schedule progress** across key construction activities  
- Identify **critical-path delays** and their root causes  
- Provide **board-level recommendations** to ensure completion under budget  

---

## 🧩 Tools & Skills Demonstrated
- **Tableau** – dashboard design, data blending, calculated fields  
- **Excel** – data cleaning, aggregation, performance tracking  
- **Project Analytics** – schedule variance, budget utilization, critical-path logic  
- **Business Intelligence Communication** – translating technical data into executive-level insight  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Early-phase delays caused by **land acquisition** and **procurement issues** compressed the construction timeline.  
- **Acceleration in Q4** improved completion rates but increased cost-efficiency risk.  
- By **November 2024**, **88.9 % of the annual budget** was used and overall completion reached **~93 %**.  
- Project remains **under budget**, but requires strict cost governance to meet **Feb 2025 completion**.
